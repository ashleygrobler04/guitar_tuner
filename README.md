## Why did i do this?
I like to tune my guitar with a tuner from time to time. How ever, if you're blind, there aren't a lot of apps out there that gets the job done, since they all mostly use graphical representations.
The 1 app i relied on for quite some time, was called "GStrings." After my phone got a firmware update, the app wouldn't seem to respond with speech feedback at all. So i couldn't select strings to tune.
So i decided: I can make a cross platform app using HTML and javascript, (CSS will be added at a later stage). This ment that I can actualy use the app from my phone, computer, TV if i reelly want to, the list goes on... basicly any thing that has a browser and internet connection.
The best part is that it's fully accessible. Although there aren't any representations as of yet, I do hope there will be in future when I implement the usage of a microphone to tune your guitar.
## How does it work?
This is not an advansed web project, all it does is play a sound so that you can tune your guitar.
For a list of changes, see below:
